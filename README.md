# Work Calendar
In this project I made an internal agenda for the employees of a company, where it firstly has the task registration section, in this part the employee registers with his proper name, selects the date and time of the activity, it also has a option in case the head of the company is the one who registers the task, can delegate or inherit the task to an employee, and the description of the task (that is, the activity to be carried out). On the other hand, it has a section that allows you to modify the status of the task (Selecting it with the name of the employee who registered it and with the current status of the task, if it is valid, completed or expired) then the tasks will come out through a DataGridView with the conditions indicated above, and entering the number of the task and the new status of the task, it will be changed correctly and will be reflected immediately, in the case if the employee wish see the taskings again. Finally, there is the section where you can see only the tasks that each employee has, putting the name of the employee, entering the date and time periods in which you want to view the tasks, and they will be reflected in a DataGridView according to the data previously placed.
